  "report_bad": "AI LLMs are like... magic language things made by some nerds. They're getting better cause they can understand, like, human talk and stuff. Some eggheads made LLMs and now legal peeps have less boring stuff to do. The robot thing can do their jobs (and probably better), highlighting fun bits from documents or something. Now judicial systems worldwide are getting on board with these AI LLMs. They've got this machine called GPT-3, kinda like a Shakespeare-bot for legal doohickies. And I guess the bots can do some neat tricks like read contracts and put bits in boxes. Big legal firms are buddying up with the AI LLM providers. And it looks like the AI LLMs are getting so smart, they can predict how legal squabbles will end. There’s some hubbub about these AI LLMs and some so-called 'ethical' and 'regulatory' concerns. The bot things ain't all bad though, they're helping with legal help for regular Joes and Janes. Future gossip has it that without these AI LLMs, law firms will be toast. So, there’s your report about AI LLMs. Not that I care... But hey, apparently it’s all important and stuff."
